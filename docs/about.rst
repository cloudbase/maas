About this documentation
========================

This is the documentation for Canonical's MAAS software. If you aren't
sure what that is, you should probably skip everything else and head
straight to the :ref:`orientation` section where it is explained.
Like any software though, it can be frustrating if you don't know how
bits of it work, how to achieve certain goals or what to do when
things go wrong. Amongst its various sections, this manual aims to
answer all those questions and plenty more you haven't even thought of
yet.


Getting it
----------

In a cunning move, the current documentation always lives, and is
built from, the main MAAS source code. That means that whatever MAAS
package you have installed, or even if you are really living life on
the edge and have checked out a development version from Launchpad,
this documentation should be the latest and most appropriate version
for the software you are running.  However, it is also possible that
there have been further sections or more helpful, or clearer bits
added since the package you are using was made. For this reason you
can always find the latest documentation online here:

.SH USAGE
.sp
maas\-import\-pxe\-files [\-h, \-\-help]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This is a helper script for the MAAS software. It downloads Ubuntu
images and organises them for use by MAAS in commissioning nodes.
The script is usually run regularly by a cron task, though it
needs to be run manually the first time a MAAS system is installed.
Images that are already in place are kept unchanged, unless the
version in the archive has since been updated.
.sp
The script reads a configuration file /etc/maas/import_pxe_files in
order to determine:
.sp
\fBARCHIVE:\fP
Location of the Ubuntu download archive
.sp
\fBRELEASES:\fP
Ubuntu releases to download
.sp
\fBARCHES:\fP
Architectures for which images should be downloaded
.sp
The script uses \fIwget\fP to download the kernel and initrd image for
each architecture in ARCHES and each release in RELEASES.  In addition
it copies the Intel\-architecture pre\-boot loader \fIpxelinux.0\fP (plus
some of its modules such as \fIchain.c32\fP) from its installed location in
/usr/lib/syslinux/.
.sp
These images are the minimum that\(aqs required to start installing a node.
During installation, a node may download its packages over the network.

MAAS Packaging Acceptance Testing
---------------------------------

The `test` make target will build binary packages for the current
branch using the latest packaging branch from Launchpad, *in a clean
ephemeral container*. The `build` target will install these packages
in another clean ephemeral LXC container.

Consider the `build-inner` and `test-inner` targets as bootstrap
points for further work. It may not be suitable for full automated
end-to-end testing of MAAS, so be clear about what you need to test
before investing work here. OTOH, it is a good place to quickly test
that the packages build, install and configure themselves as expected.

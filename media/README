This folder contains somewhat ephemeral things: subfolders serve as
MEDIA_ROOT for maas.demo and maas.development environments. The
media/demo directory should always exist and not be deleted, though
its contents can be. The media/development directory should be created
and destroyed by tests, as needed.
